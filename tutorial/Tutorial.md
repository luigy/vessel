# A tutorial introduction to vessel

In this example, we're going to sketch out a blog application using vessel.

First, some preliminaries:

```haskell

module Tutorial where

import Prelude hiding (id, (.), filter)

import Control.Category
import Control.Lens
import Control.Monad
import Control.Monad.IO.Class
import Control.Monad.Fix
import Data.Aeson (FromJSON(..), ToJSON(..))
import Data.Aeson.GADT.TH (deriveJSONGADT)
import Data.Align
import Data.Proxy
import Data.Map (Map)
import Data.Map.Monoidal (MonoidalMap(..))
import Data.Semigroup (First(..), Max(..))
import Data.Semigroup.Commutative (Commutative)
import Data.Dependent.Map (DMap)
import Data.Text (Text)
import Reflex
import Reflex.Network
import qualified Data.Map as Map
import qualified Data.Map.Merge.Strict as Map

import Data.Vessel
import Data.Vessel.ViewMorphism
import Data.Vessel.Vessel
import Data.Vessel.Map
import Data.Vessel.Identity

import Data.GADT.Compare.TH
import Data.GADT.Show.TH
import Data.Constraint.Extras.TH

type PostId = Int
type Post = Text

```

Next we'll define "query" type, which captures the kinds of queries we can have...

```haskell

data Qsimple g = Qsimple
  { _q_posts :: GrpMap PostId g -- ^ a map from post ID's to refcounts, represents querying for that post
  , _q_latestPostId :: GrpMap () g -- ^ morally a "bool"; for if the maxPost Id is being requested.
  } deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Read)

```

And the corresponding result type.  Note that we have the same set of fields occur in both.

```haskell

data Rsimple = Rsimple
  { _r_posts :: MonoidalMap PostId (First (Maybe Post)) -- ^ posts
  , _r_latestPostId :: MonoidalMap () (Max (Maybe PostId)) -- ^ the max post id;
  } deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Read)

```
Now we end up needing to produce some boilerplate instances for our queries;
QueryT (the only "real" instance for MonadQuery) requires that the query type
be a Group.  It does this for essentially performance reasons.  If 100 widgets
have queries, and one of them "goes away", then we can either add the remaining
99 queries **or** subtract the removed query from the total for all 100 we already
have.  The latter is almost always quicker.

```haskell

instance (Eq g, Monoid g) => Semigroup (Qsimple g) where Qsimple x y <> Qsimple x' y' = Qsimple (x <> x') (y <> y')
instance (Eq g, Monoid g) => Monoid (Qsimple g) where mempty = Qsimple mempty mempty
instance (Eq g, Group g) => Group (Qsimple g) where negateG (Qsimple x y) = Qsimple (negateG x) (negateG y)
instance (Eq g, Monoid g, Commutative g) => Commutative (Qsimple g)
instance GrpFunctor Qsimple where mapG f (Qsimple x y) = Qsimple (mapG f x) (mapG f y)

```

MonadQuery Also requires that QueryResult be a monoid;  this reflects the idea
that the result can be updated as new data is sent to the frontend; with
"updates" being appended to the left.  That's the reason for the First and Max
values above.

Those are also the reason for the Maybe wrappers in both cases,  it's
necessary to distinguish the two states of "the data is absent because it
doesn't exist in the backend" from "the data is absent because you haven't
received it yet".

```haskell

instance Semigroup Rsimple where Rsimple posts maxId <> Rsimple posts' maxId' = Rsimple (posts <> posts') (maxId <> maxId')
instance Monoid Rsimple where { mempty = Rsimple mempty mempty }

```

We associate the two types, query and response, with Query;  which is also
essentially boilerplate code.  The single method for Query; crop, should
restrict the query result to only that which matches the query.  Crop has two
essential duties.  It's used in query handlers that call runQueryT.

```haskell

instance Query (Qsimple g) where
  type QueryResult (Qsimple g) = Rsimple
  crop (Qsimple postsQ maxIdQ) (Rsimple postsR maxIdR) = Rsimple (cropMap postsQ postsR) (cropMap maxIdQ maxIdR)
    where cropMap q r = MonoidalMap $ Map.intersection (getMonoidalMap r) (unGrpMap q)

```

We now can write code that "queries" for posts.  Note that the distinction
between "not yet loaded" and "doesnt exist at all" is reflected in two
different Maybe's.  Resist the urge to "join" the two together.  That's a sure
recipe for annoying glitches which flash "deleted" right before showing the
user their data.

Once again we see some amount of boilerplate; we construct the query by
building up from the given field; and then need to tear down the query result
by examining the corresponding field.

```haskell

watchPost 
  :: ( MonadQuery t (Qsimple SelectedCount) m
     , QueryResult (Qsimple SelectedCount) ~ Rsimple
     , Reflex t
     , Monad m
     )
  => Dynamic t PostId -> m (Dynamic t (Maybe (Maybe Post)))
watchPost postIds = do
  queryResult <- queryDyn $ ffor postIds $ \postId -> mempty { _q_posts = GrpMap (Map.singleton postId 1) }
  return $ ffor2 postIds queryResult $ \postId r -> getFirst <$> view (at postId) (_r_posts r)

watchLatestPostId
  :: ( MonadQuery t (Qsimple SelectedCount) m
     , QueryResult (Qsimple SelectedCount) ~ Rsimple
     , Reflex t
     , Monad m
     )
  => m (Dynamic t (Maybe (Maybe PostId)))
watchLatestPostId = do
  queryResult <- queryDyn $ constDyn $  mempty { _q_latestPostId = GrpMap (Map.singleton () 1) }
  return $ ffor queryResult $ \r -> getMax <$> view (at ()) (_r_latestPostId r)

displayLatestPost
  :: ( MonadHold t m
     , MonadFix m
     , MonadQuery t (Qsimple SelectedCount) m
     , QueryResult (Qsimple SelectedCount) ~ Rsimple
     , Reflex t
     , PostBuild t m
     , Widget t m
     )
  => m ()
displayLatestPost = do
  mdmId <- maybeDyn =<< watchLatestPostId
  dyn_ $ ffor mdmId $ \case
    Nothing -> text "Loading ..."
    Just dmId -> do
      mdId <- maybeDyn dmId
      dyn_ $ ffor mdId $ \case
        Nothing -> text "No posts found"
        Just dId -> displayPost dId

displayPost
  :: ( MonadQuery t (Qsimple SelectedCount) m
     , QueryResult (Qsimple SelectedCount) ~ Rsimple
     , PostBuild t m
     , MonadHold t m
     , MonadFix m
     , Widget t m
     )
  => Dynamic t PostId -> m ()
displayPost postId = do
  mdmPost <- maybeDyn =<< watchPost postId
  dyn_ $ ffor mdmPost $ \case
    Nothing -> text "Loading post ..."
    Just dmPost -> do
      mdPost <- maybeDyn dmPost
      dyn_ $ ffor mdPost $ \case
        Nothing -> text "Post Not Found"
        Just dPost -> dynText dPost

```

We can try to improve the situation in essentially all of
these cases above by factoring out the common parts using
something resembling the HKD Pattern; when we need to
associate a group with each query; we can use `Const g`; and
for the result which demands only the result data for that
key, we can use Identity. A downside is boilerplate
instances, even ones that can normally be derived.

```haskell

data Qhkd (f :: * -> *) = Qhkd
  { _qhkd_posts :: MonoidalMap PostId (f (First (Maybe Post))) -- ^ posts
  , _qhkd_latestPostId :: MonoidalMap () (f (Max (Maybe PostId))) -- ^ the max post id;
  }

type Qhkd_query g = Qhkd (Const g)
type Qhkd_response = Qhkd Identity

```

We can instead observe the pattern that "most" of the shape of a record of
queries/responses can be  decomposed into products of maps.  Another way of
expressing the same concept is with a DMap.  with this approach:

```haskell

data Qtag (a :: *) where
  Qtag_Posts        :: PostId -> Qtag (First (Maybe Post))
  Qtag_LatestPostId :: Qtag (Max (Maybe PostId))

type Qtag_query g = DMap Qtag (Const g)
type Qtag_response = DMap Qtag Identity

```

Vessel takes this idea a bit further; where the above approach uses parameters
as values, vessel makes it "recursive";  the GADTs used have "functor"
parameters, and most of the applied types are also functor parametric.

```haskell

data Qvessel (v :: (* -> *) -> *) where
  Posts        :: Qvessel (MapV PostId (First (Maybe Post)))
  LatestPostId :: Qvessel (IdentityV (Max (Maybe PostId)))

```
Using this sort of construction allows us to eliminate nearly all of the
boilerplate; there's a small amount of TH to derive GCompare and all of the
remaining instances follow from the view types in vessel:

```haskell

viewPost :: (MonadQuery t (Vessel Qvessel (Const SelectedCount)) m, Reflex t, Monad m)
  => Dynamic t PostId -> m (Dynamic t (Maybe (Maybe Post)))
viewPost postIds = (fmap.fmap.fmap) (getFirst . runIdentity) $ queryViewMorphism 1 $ ffor postIds $ \pid -> vessel Posts . mapVMorphism pid

viewLatestPostId :: (MonadQuery t (Vessel Qvessel (Const SelectedCount)) m, Reflex t, Monad m)
  => m (Dynamic t (Maybe (Maybe PostId)))
viewLatestPostId = (fmap.fmap.fmap) (getMax . runIdentity) $ queryViewMorphism 1 $ constDyn $ vessel LatestPostId . identityV

```
Feel free to ignore everything below this line; this is just to force me to get
other types "right".
